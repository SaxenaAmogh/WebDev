## My process

This was a basic webpage made using HTML and CSS. I used CSS styling for making the webpage as similar to the given design as I possibly could.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### Continued development

This is my first submition and I am new to development, but I am determined to gather more and more knowlegde and contribute more in the future to various types of problems, projects etc.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) - This helped me with some CSS basics. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
